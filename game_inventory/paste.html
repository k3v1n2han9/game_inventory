        All products purchased with pre-order items would be dispatched together
        when all pre-order items in the order become available. Pre-order items
        are likely to be delayed.

            to allow in-stock items to reach you faster.

            As our supplier hasn’t provided a detailed release/restock date, so it
            is likely to delay. Thus, we strongly recommend you to order this item
            separately with all other items to avoid the possible late dispatch of
            the whole order.
